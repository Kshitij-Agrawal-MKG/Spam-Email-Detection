## About The Project

Spam detection is crucial in filtering out unwanted or unsolicited messages, such as emails or text messages. It involves employing machine learning algorithms to analyze message content and identify patterns associated with spam. This repository offers a Python script utilizing various machine learning models for classifying spam messages from ham messages.

### Built With

- NumPy
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Sklearn

You can install all the mentioned libraries at once by executing the following command:

sh
pip install -r requirements.txt


## Data Description

The project utilizes the Email-Spam dataset from Kaggle, containing 5,572 emails with two features: 'Message' and 'Category'.

- **Message:** Contains the text of the email.
- **Category:** Distinguishes between spam and ham emails.

## Data Pre-processing

### Steps Taken:

- Dropped 'Unnamed: 2', 'Unnamed: 3', and 'Unnamed: 4' columns.
- Converted 'Category' column to binary values.
- Split dataset into training and testing sets using `train_test_split()` from `sklearn.model_selection`.
- Transformed emails into numerical features using `TfidfVectorizer()` from `sklearn.feature_extraction.text`.

## Model Training and Evaluation

The dataset is split into training and testing sets for model training and evaluation. Various machine learning algorithms are utilized:

- Logistic Regression
- K Nearest Neighbors
- Decision Trees
- Random Forest
- Stacking model

Evaluation metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score are used to assess model performance.

## Model Deployment

The project includes a `Spam Classification Deployment.py` file containing code for deployment using Streamlit, enabling the creation of interactive web applications for machine learning and data science projects.
